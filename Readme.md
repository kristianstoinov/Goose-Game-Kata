# The Goose Game Kata
The Goose Game is a game where two or more players move pieces on a game board containing 63 squares by rolling a die. 
The aim of the game is to be the first one to reach the last square.

This repository is an attempt to solve the programming Kata presented here: 
[goose-game-kata](https://github.com/xpeppers/goose-game-kata).

# Instructions
## Buillding and running
The project uses sbt as the build tool. Therefore the usual commands apply.

1. Launch sbt in the repository : `sbt`
2. Compile: `compile`
3. Run the tests: `test`
4. Launch the program: `runMain com.bitrock.application.GooseGameApp`

Alternatively the application can be run within the IDE, e.g. IntelliJ.

## Input commands
- Type `add player <name>` to add a player.
- Type `move <name> 3, 4` to move the player with a specific dice roll.
- Type `move <name>` if you want the system to move the player.
- Type `quit` at any moment to quit the game.
- Have Fun!

# Limitations
- The system does not keep track of the players turns, therefore a player can play as many times in a row as he or she 
may want.

# Sample output
